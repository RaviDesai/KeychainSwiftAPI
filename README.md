KeychainSwiftAPI
================

This Keychain Swift API library is a wrapper of iOS C Keychain Framework.
It allows easily and securely storing sensitive data in secure keychain store
in Swift projects. Interfacing with the original C keychain API is combersome from
Swift, and is prone to errors which lead to security vulnerabilities. This
library is written according to the best security coding practices and guidelines.
